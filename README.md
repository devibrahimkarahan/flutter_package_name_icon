## ðŸ§¾ Guide
#### 1. Setup the config file

Add your Flutter app name, app package, app icon configuration to your `pubspec.yaml` or create a new config file called `flutter_package_name_icon.yaml`. 
```yaml
dev_dependencies: 
  flutter_package_name_icon:
    git: git://github.com/devibrahimkarahan/flutter_package_name_icon.git

flutter_package_name_icon:
  name: "App name"
  package: "com.your.package"
  flutter_icons:
    image_path: "assets/my_launcher_icon.png"
    android: true
    ios: true
```
For more attributes of flutter_icons: [flutter_launcher_icons]

If you name your configuration file something other than `flutter_package_name_icon.yaml` or `pubspec.yaml` you will need to specify the name of the file when running the package.

```
flutter pub get
flutter pub run flutter_package_name_icon:main -f <your config file name here>
```

Note: If you are not using the existing `pubspec.yaml` ensure that your config file is located in the same directory as it.

#### 2. Run the package

```
flutter pub get
flutter pub run flutter_package_name_icon:main
```

The package will replace necessary fields on iOS and Android folders what you define.
